## 📌 Business Context
In the FMCG retail sector, accurate demand planning is crucial to avoid **Stock-outs** (lost revenue) and **Overstock** (waste & storage costs). This project simulates a real-world scenario where store managers need reliable 6-week sales forecasts to optimize inventory and staffing.

## 🎯 Project Goals
1.  **Forecast Accuracy:** Minimize MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) to improve inventory planning.
2.  **Promotion Analysis:** Quantify the impact of promotions and holidays on sales volume.
3.  **Store Segmentation:** Cluster stores based on purchasing behavior to tailor forecasting strategies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, SQL (simulated via Pandas merge)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Modeling:** Facebook Prophet (Time Series), XGBoost (ML Regressor)
* **Evaluation:** MAPE, RMSE

## Dataset
The data used in this project comes from the [Rossmann Store Sales Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales).
